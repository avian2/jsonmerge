2021-01-23	jsonmerge	1.8.0

	* Allow "idRef" option for arrayMergeById strategy to be an array of
	  pointers.
	* Warn that "meta" argument is deprecated.

2019-09-01	jsonmerge	1.7.0

	* Add "merge_options" argument to the Merger.merge method, a more
	  generic replacement for the "meta" argument. "meta" argument still
	  works, however its use is now deprecated and it may be removed in a
	  future release. Third-party code that subclasses the Strategy class
	  and depends on the "meta" argument may need to be updated.
	* Add arrayMergeByIndex merge strategy.


2019-05-15	jsonmerge	1.6.1

	* Fix assertion failure when object contains a float NaN value.

2019-03-14	jsonmerge	1.6.0

	* Add validatorclass argument to Merge constructor.
	* Fix errors in reference resolution with jsonschema>=3.0.0.
	* This release removes the requirement for jsonschema<3.0.0 in
	  setup.py.

2018-11-05	jsonmerge	1.5.2

	* Fix exception on Python 2.7 when objects contain non-ASCII keys.
	* Require jsonschema<3.0.0 in setup.py since some tests currently fail
	  with jsonschema 3.0.0 pre-releases.
	* More descriptive error messages in ArrayMergeById strategy.

2018-05-01	jsonmerge	1.5.1

	* Fix exception when additionalProperties keyword is a boolean value.
	* Fix an issue with arrayMergeById strategy, where a wrong list item was
	  merged in some cases, or an "Unresolvable JSON pointer" exception
	  raised. See issue #31 on GitHub (thanks to fdearle).

2018-03-23	jsonmerge	1.5.0

	* Fix "maximum recursion depth exceeded" in get_schema() with schemas
	  that have recursive references.
	* Allow a merge strategy to be defined at the same level as "anyOf",
	  "allOf" and "oneOf" keywords (thanks to Henrique Cabral).
	* Add reference to the offending JSON value in exceptions thrown by
	  jsonmerge.
	* Add "discard" merge strategy.
	* Raise SchemaError when encountering an unknown merge strategy name.

2017-06-05	jsonmerge	1.4.0

	* More consistent handling of $ref references in get_schema(). Internal
	  references are now followed, but always kept unresolved in the final
	  result instead of replacing them with the referenced part of the
	  document. External references are never followed. This removes the
	  need to call resolve_refs() in custom merge strategies.
	* Support for "oneOf" schema keyword.
	* Fix compatibility with jsonschema > 2.4.0.
	* Remove support for Python 2.6.

	  characters.
	* Add LICENSE file.

	* Fix handling of additionalProperties (thanks to nxkb).
	* Add optional debug output through the logging module.
	* Fix arrayMergeById strategy when base instance has no "id" property.

2014-09-20	jsonmerge	1.1.0

	* Add ArrayMergeById strategy (thanks to Sarah Bird).
	* merge() and get_schema() methods now raise more specific exception
	  classes on error (BaseInstanceError, HeadInstanceError, SchemaError).
	* Rename "unique" option for Version strategy to "ignoreDups".
	* Fix duplicate entries with Version strategy even when "ignoreDups"
	  was True (thanks to Sarah Bird).
	* Always add "type" keyword when making new objects in get_schema().
	* Remove "maxItems" and "uniqueItems" keywords in get_schema() for
	  Append strategy.
	* Use setuptools for packaging (thanks to Sarah Bird).
